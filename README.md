=============

This application is my first Android application as a beginner amateur developper.
My main goal is to monitor the battery discharge over time. The application will display the current battery state, be able to save this status over time as a service and plot all the information on easy reading graphs.

What makes it different than other battery apps ?
It will give more information to users than just a view of what appened but also statistics like typical discharge rate, remaining battery life.

What's next ?
It's already a start! As a beginner, I learn as I code and I code as I learn, so I am not expecting this all working before Christmas 2013.
I'd like to add some battery life improvment functionnality to this app and monitor how much it changes the discharge rate.
- Cutting off data when not needed, in the same way as bluetooth, wifi...
- Tweak parameters on scheduled day period (work hours, sleep hours, WE)
